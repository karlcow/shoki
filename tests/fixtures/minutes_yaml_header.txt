# Walden (Henry David Thoreau)
Let us first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over our brows, and take up a little life into our pores.

Do not stay to be an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world.
henry: To be awake is to be alive.
david: I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born.
