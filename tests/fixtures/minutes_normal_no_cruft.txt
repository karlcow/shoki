Some intro prose.
On one or more line

# Walden (Henry David Thoreau)
Let us first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over our brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to be an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world.
henry: To be awake is to be alive.
david: I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born.

# A Moveable Feast (Hemingway)
Then there was the bad weather. It would come in one day when the fall was over.
ernest: We would have to shut the windows in the night against the rain and the cold wind would strip the leaves from the trees in the Place Contrescarpe. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway
hemingway: The leaves lay sodden in the rain and the wind drove the rain against the big green autobus at the terminal and the Caf√© des Amateurs was crowded and the windows misted over from the heat and the smoke inside.
